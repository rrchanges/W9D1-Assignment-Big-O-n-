# W9D1-Assignment-Big-O-n-

The breakdown for Algorith 1: Liner Search.  
  Best case: If the target element is the first element in the array. then the time complexity is O(1).
  Worst Case: if the target element is not in the array or is the last element then the time complexity is O(n).

For the Bubble Sort:
  Best case: if the array is already sorted then the loop only runs once and the time complexity is O(n). 
  Worst case: if the array is sorted in teh reverse order, the maximum number of comparisons and swaps are needed. The time complexity is O(n^2).
